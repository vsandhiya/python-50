Capitalize!

You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.

Sample Input

chris alan

Sample Output

Chris Alan

Note: in a word only the first character is capitalized. Example 12abc when capitalized remains 12abc.
